Summary
I'm working on an solar design for my home and need assistance sizing breakers and electrical panels.

I have 400A service with two separate 200A lines feeding two separate breaker boxes.

I don't know the actual load on each of the two main breaker boxes, but I suspect its quite a bit less than the main breakers (150A) each.

I have two solar arrays:
1. 30 panels producing 48A continuous
2. 32 panels producing 51.2A continuous

Array 1 will feed breaker box 1 (200A w/150A main breaker)
Array 2 will feed breaker box 2 (150A w/150A main breaker)

Power from each array passed through a separate Enphase Combiner Box 6C before terminating in each breaker box.

Each system will have 1 Enphase 10C batteries (but I want room to upgrade to two batteries on each system).

Each Enphase system consists of microinverters (IQ8HC) on each panel, a Combiner Box 6c, and a Meter Collar which creates a microgrid when the grid is down.  The Meter Collar is rated 200A.

Please see the One Line Diagrams, and the system specs for the proposed equipment.

I need help with:
1. What is the needed capacity of each of the main load panels (amp capacity) to support the additional back feed from solar / batteries?
2. What size breakers are needed for the solar back feed from combiner box to each of the breaker boxes (which will have to support the solar from one array plus the battery(ies) passing from the combiner 6c.
3. If there are issues with capacity (from the number of existing circuits or the addition of solar/battery), how would you recommend to resolve them?
4. Will this configuration (main load panels, plus solar / battery) meet NEC standards?
5. (optional) Can you sign the electrical drawings in Massachusetts?
